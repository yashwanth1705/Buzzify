# Buzzify - Campus Messaging Portal
## Complete Project Report

### 1. Executive Summary
**Buzzify** is a smart messaging website designed specifically for colleges. It helps Administrators, Staff, and Students communicate easily and effectively. Unlike messy email chains or physical notice boards that get ignored, Buzzify ensures important announcements reach the right people instantly.

### 2. The Problem: Why We Built This
In many colleges, communication is broken.
- **Important notices get lost** in spam folders or WhatsApp groups.
- **Students miss deadlines** because they didn't see the announcement.
- **Staff cannot verify** if students actually read their messages.
- **Information overload** happens when everyone receives every message, even the ones not relevant to them.

We needed a better way to send the right message, to the right person, at the right time.

### 3. The Solution: What Buzzify Does
Buzzify replaces the chaos with a central, organized hub.
- **Targeted Messaging**: Send messages only to "Computer Science Students" or "All Staff".
- **Priority Levels**: Mark urgent messages as "High Priority" so they stand out (in Red).
- **Read Receipts**: Senders can see who has read and acknowledged their message.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admins have full control, while students see a clean, distraction-free feed.
